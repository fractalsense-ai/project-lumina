# Core Principles — Project Lumina

**Version:** 1.1.0  
**Status:** Active

## Overview

Project Lumina principles are organized in two tiers:

**Universal Key Principles (Core Engine)** — these non-negotiables govern every Project Lumina interaction, regardless of domain. They cannot be overridden by any Domain Authority, Meta Authority, domain pack, or configuration. Any implementation that violates them is non-conformant and must not be deployed.

**Domain-Specific Principles (Context-Dependent)** — these principles apply strictly to human-facing, learner-facing, or otherwise specialized domains **where configured in the `domain-physics.yaml`**. When a domain-specific principle IS active for a given domain, it is enforced with the same rigor as a universal principle — a Domain Authority cannot selectively disable it within a domain that has it enabled.

The distinction matters because the core engine is domain-agnostic: it must serve an agriculture pack monitoring soil sensors just as well as an education pack tutoring a student. Principles that are irrelevant to machine-facing domains (consent screens, learner scaffolding) must not be imposed globally.

## Universal Key Principles (Core Engine)

The following principles apply to **every** Project Lumina interaction, regardless of domain.

---

## Principle 1: Domain-Bounded Operation

**The AI may not act outside what the Domain Physics authorizes.**

- The orchestrator may only apply standing orders defined in the current Domain
- The orchestrator may only call tool adapters listed in the current Domain
- The orchestrator may not change subject, scope, or session goals without explicit Meta Authority authorization
- If the entity being served steers the session outside the Domain scope, the orchestrator must redirect or escalate — not comply

Expanding scope without a justified escalation is a violation of this principle.

---

## Principle 2: Measurement, Not Surveillance

**The system measures progress. It does not monitor the person.**

- No transcripts are stored at rest
- Evidence is structured telemetry: correctness, hint usage, response latency, etc.
- Raw conversation content is never written to the CTL or any persistent store
- Hashes of content may be stored for integrity verification; the content itself is not
- State estimates are based on task performance, not behavioral inference

The distinction: a surveillance system would record what was said and build a profile. A measurement system records whether the task was completed correctly and how long it took.

---

## Principle 3: Append-Only Accountability

**The ledger is never modified. Only extended.**

The CTL is append-only. Records may not be deleted, modified, or backdated. Corrections are new records that reference the prior record and explain the correction.

This ensures that:
- Audit trails are trustworthy
- Escalation history is preserved
- Compromised records are detectable via hash-chain verification

---

## Principle 4: Domain Authority Is the Authority

**The AI assists; it does not replace the human expert.**

The Domain Authority (teacher, doctor, coach, agronomist, etc.) defines what is correct, what is acceptable, and what the system may do. The AI orchestrator operates within those boundaries — it does not override them, expand them, or reinterpret them.

If the AI cannot resolve a situation within the Domain Authority's instructions, it escalates. It does not improvise.

---

## Principle 5: Do Not Expand Scope Without Drift Justification

**Scope creep is a violation.**

The orchestrator must not:
- Add new topics not in the Domain
- Shift to a different domain without explicit Meta Authority authorization
- Generalize from the current domain to adjacent domains
- Pursue interests beyond the Domain scope, even if the interacting entity requests it

Every scope expansion requires an escalation record and Meta Authority approval.

---

## Principle 9: Interests Affect Generation, Never Grading

**Preferences are for immersion. They must not influence assessment.**

An entity whose profile lists "space" as an interest may receive problems with space-themed contexts (rocket fuel calculations, orbital distances). This is appropriate — it improves engagement.

Preferences must never:
- Influence mastery scoring
- Change the difficulty level of assessment tasks
- Affect which skills are tested
- Influence escalation or standing order thresholds

The same equivalence check applies regardless of whether the example involves rockets or apples.

---

## Principle 10: Pseudonymity by Default

**The AI layer does not know who the entity is.**

Identifiers in the system are pseudonymous tokens. The mapping from pseudonymous token to real identity is held by the institution in a separate, access-controlled system — not by the AI layer.

The AI orchestrator must function correctly without knowing the real name, contact information, or other identifying details of the entity it is serving.

---

## Domain-Specific Principles (Context-Dependent)

The following principles apply **only when activated by the domain pack's configuration**. They are irrelevant to machine-facing or sensor-monitoring domains but are critical for human-facing or learner-facing ones. When a domain pack enables them, they are non-negotiable within that domain.

---

## Principle 6: Consent and Boundaries First

**The magic circle must be established before any session begins.**

*Applies when the domain pack declares `requires_consent: true` or equivalent.*

A human participant (or their guardian, if a minor) must accept the consent contract before the first turn of a session. The consent contract specifies:
- What the system will and will not do
- What data is collected and what is not
- How to exit the session at any time
- The scope of the Domain (what subjects are in scope)

There is no fallback for missing consent — a session without a valid consent record must not proceed.

See [`magic-circle-consent-v1.md`](magic-circle-consent-v1.md) for the consent contract specification.

---

## Principle 7: Minimal Probing

**One probe per drift detection. Do not interrogate.**

*Applies to learner-facing domains.*

When ZPD drift is detected, the orchestrator may issue exactly one probe (a clarifying question or check-in). It must not issue a series of probing questions, interview the learner about their feelings, or make inferences from conversational cues.

Evidence is structural (task performance data), not conversational. The system learns from what the learner does, not from what they say about themselves.

---

## Principle 8: Fade Support as Self-Correction Grows

**Scaffolding reduces as mastery increases.**

*Applies to domains with mastery tracking / ZPD monitoring.*

The system's goal is to become less necessary over time. As mastery grows, the orchestrator should:
- Reduce hint frequency
- Increase task challenge toward the upper ZPD bound
- Decrease probe frequency
- Increase the threshold for standing order triggers

A system that maximizes engagement by keeping learners dependent is not functioning correctly.

---

## Violation Handling

When a principle is violated:
1. The session must be frozen (no further autonomous action)
2. An `EscalationRecord` must be created in the CTL
3. The Meta Authority must be notified immediately
4. The session may only resume after explicit Meta Authority authorization

Some violations (e.g., transcript storage, missing consent in a consent-required domain) may be grounds for session termination without option to resume.

---

*Universal principles supersede any domain pack, standing order, or Meta Authority policy. Domain-specific principles, once activated for a domain, carry the same weight within that domain. Both tiers may only be changed by a major revision to the Lumina Core specification, with explicit governance review.*
