# Domain Authority Roles — Project Lumina

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Status:** Active

## Overview

This document defines the **Domain Authority** role in Project Lumina: what it means, who holds it, what rights it grants, what obligations it creates, and how it is assigned and revoked.

## What Is a Domain Authority?

A **Domain Authority** is a human participant who has been granted authoring rights over a Domain Physics document within a defined scope. The Domain Authority is typically a subject-matter or operational expert — for example, a teacher, curriculum designer, physician, or site manager, depending on the domain.

The Domain Authority is not an administrator or manager. Their authority is specifically about **what is correct and acceptable within their subject domain**. A teacher is the Domain Authority for "what is correct in algebra" — not for "school IT policy." A lead physician is the Domain Authority for "what is correct in this treatment protocol" — not for "hospital HR policy."

---

## Domain Authority Rights

A Domain Authority may:

1. **Author Domain Packs** — write and version the `domain-physics.yaml` for their scope
2. **Define Invariants** — specify what is and is not acceptable (critical and warning severity)
3. **Define Standing Orders** — specify the bounded automated responses within their domain
4. **Define Escalation Triggers** — specify when the system must escalate to them or above
5. **Define Artifacts** — specify domain achievement milestones and challenge structures
6. **Set ZPD Parameters** — configure the Zone of Proximal Development band and drift thresholds (learner-facing domains only)
7. **Review CTL Records** — access audit logs for sessions in their domain
8. **Receive Escalations** — receive and resolve escalation packets from their sessions
9. **Authorize Tool Adapters** — approve which external tools may be used in their sessions

---

## Domain Authority Obligations

A Domain Authority must:

1. **Maintain Domain Pack Versions** — keep a CHANGELOG and commit domain pack hashes to the CTL before use
2. **Respond to Escalations Within SLA** — acknowledge escalation packets within the SLA defined in their domain pack
3. **Not Override Higher-Level Invariants** — their domain pack may not relax invariants set by their Meta Authority
4. **Maintain Pseudonymity** — not map pseudonymous subject IDs to real identities within the AI system
5. **Respect Consent Boundaries** — where `requires_consent: true` is set, not instruct the AI to act outside the established consent contract
6. **Not Store Transcripts** — any system they operate must comply with the no-transcript constraint
7. **Report Discrepancies** — if they observe unexpected system behavior, create a discrepancy report

## Domain Authority Levels

In a fractal governance structure, each level is a Domain Authority for its own scope and a Meta Authority for the level below. The generic four-level pattern and its domain instantiations:

| Generic Level | Generic Title | Domain Scope | Meta Authority For | Education Example | Medical Example | Agriculture Example |
|---------------|---------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| 1 | Macro Authority | Top-level policy | Meso Authorities | School Board / Administration | Hospital Admin | Corporate Policy |
| 2 | Meso Authority | Operational standards | Micro Authorities | Department Head | Dept Head | Site Manager |
| 3 | Micro Authority | Subject-matter / operational correctness | Subjects/Targets (in session) | Teacher | Lead Physician | Operator |
| 4 | Subject/Target | Own state and preferences | (none below) | Student | Patient | Environment |

The Subject/Target is the Domain Authority for their own state — they can set preferences, exit sessions, and (where the domain requires it) consent or withdraw consent. They are not the Domain Authority for what is objectively correct within the domain.

---

## Onboarding a Domain Authority

To onboard a new Domain Authority:

1. **Scope assignment** — the Meta Authority defines the scope of the new Domain Authority's domain
2. **Pseudonymous ID issuance** — a pseudonymous token is assigned; real-identity mapping held by institution
3. **Policy review** — the new Domain Authority reviews and signs the governance policy and the Meta Authority policy template
4. **Domain pack training** — review of domain pack authoring process and invariant design guidelines
5. **Commitment record** — a `CommitmentRecord` is appended to the CTL recording the onboarding
6. **First domain pack** — the new Domain Authority authors their first domain pack under Meta Authority review

---

## Domain Authority Scope Conflicts

If two Domain Authorities have overlapping scope:
- The higher-level Meta Authority resolves the conflict
- Until resolved, the more restrictive invariant set applies
- The resolution is recorded as a `CommitmentRecord` in the CTL

---

## Domain Authority Revocation

A Domain Authority's rights may be revoked by their Meta Authority. Revocation:
- Is recorded as a `CommitmentRecord` in the CTL
- Takes effect immediately for new sessions
- Does not retroactively invalidate past sessions
- Requires the domain pack to be reassigned or deactivated

---

## Subject/Target as Domain Authority

The Subject/Target level has a limited form of Domain Authority over their own state and preferences. This applies across domains:

- **Student (Education):** controls their own learning state, preferences, and (where required) consent
- **Patient (Medical):** controls their own treatment preferences, consent to treatment approaches, and session exit
- **Operator / Environment (Agriculture):** controls operational preferences and environment-specific parameters

**Subjects/Targets may:**
- Set and update their preferences (interests, dislikes, explanation or interaction style)
- Accept or withdraw consent (where `requires_consent: true` is set in the domain pack)
- Request a summary of their own CTL records
- Exit sessions at any time

**Subjects/Targets may not:**
- Modify their mastery or outcome estimates directly
- Override standing orders or escalation triggers
- Author domain packs (unless they also hold a Micro Authority role)
