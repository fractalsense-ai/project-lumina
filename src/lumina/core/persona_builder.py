"""
persona_builder.py — Universal base identity and contextual persona assembly.

Every LLM and SLM call in Project Lumina begins with a unified identity layer
(``UNIVERSAL_BASE_IDENTITY``) that establishes what the system fundamentally is.
Role-specific directives then narrow the operational latent space to exactly what
that call requires — no more.

Usage::

    from lumina.core.persona_builder import build_system_prompt, PersonaContext

    # For a user-facing conversational session:
    system = build_system_prompt(
        PersonaContext.CONVERSATIONAL,
        domain_override=domain_prompt_text,
    )

    # For an internal SLM glossary render:
    system = build_system_prompt(PersonaContext.LIBRARIAN)
