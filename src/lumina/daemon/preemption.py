"""preemption.py — Cooperative yielding protocol.

Provides ``PreemptionToken`` (passed to tasks at dispatch time) and
``TaskPreempted`` (raised at checkpoints when the daemon requests yield).

Design
------
Tasks call ``await token.checkpoint()`` (async) or
``token.checkpoint_sync()`` (thread) at natural break points — e.g.
between processing each domain in a night-cycle task.  If the daemon
has called ``token.request_yield()`` because user load spiked, the
next checkpoint raises ``TaskPreempted`` and the task unwinds cleanly.

Tasks that never call checkpoints simply run to completion; preemption
is opt-in and backward-compatible.
