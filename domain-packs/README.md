# Domain Packs — Project Lumina

Domain packs are the authored rulesets that bound a Project Lumina session to a specific subject area. This directory contains the authored domain packs for the Project Lumina reference implementation.

Each domain owns its own:
- principles
- rules and invariants
- state model and domain-lib estimators
- domain physics and standing-order vocabulary

Root documentation defines universal engine behavior only.

## What Is a Domain Pack?

A domain pack is the **D (Domain)** pillar of the D.S.A. Framework. It defines:

- **Invariants** — conditions that must always hold (critical or warning severity)
- **Standing Orders** — bounded automated responses the orchestrator may take
- **Escalation Triggers** — when to pass control to the Meta Authority
- **Artifacts** — milestones that can be earned in this domain
- **Subsystem Configuration** — domain-specific domain-lib parameters and drift thresholds

See [`../docs/7-concepts/domain-profile-spec.md`](../docs/7-concepts/domain-profile-spec.md) for the full authoring specification.

### Three-layer distinction

Domain packs use three distinct component types. They are different in how the core engine interacts with them:

| Layer | Location | Called by | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Tool adapters** | `modules/<module>/tool-adapters/` | Core engine (via `tool_call_policies`) | Active verifiers — deterministically check LLM proposals on specific actions |
| **Domain library** | `domain-lib/` specs + `controllers/` implementations | Runtime adapter (`runtime_adapters.py`) | Passive state estimators — ZPD, fluency, fatigue — never called directly by the engine |
| **Runtime adapter** | `controllers/runtime_adapters.py` | Core engine (`interpret_turn_input`) | Synthesis layer — runs NLP pre-processing (Phase A) and signal synthesis (Phase B), calls domain-lib internally, writes engine contract fields |
| **World-sim persona** | `world-sim/` (optional) | Domain runtime adapter — selected once at session start in `build_initial_learning_state`; theme hint injected on every turn via `interpret_turn_input` | Narrative framing layer — cosmetic only; domain physics and invariants are unchanged. Three files: spec (parameters), consent (activation gate), mastery (reward surface). |

See [`docs/7-concepts/domain-adapter-pattern.md`](../docs/7-concepts/domain-adapter-pattern.md) for the full authoring guide including the engine contract field reference and the `problem_solved` / `problem_status` pattern.

See [`docs/7-concepts/world-sim-persona-pattern.md`](../docs/7-concepts/world-sim-persona-pattern.md) for the full persona pattern reference, including static vs. dynamic theme selection, configuration layout, and the implementation checklist for adding a world-sim to a new domain.

## How to Author a Domain Pack

### 1. Create the directory

```bash
mkdir -p domain-packs/{org}/{subject-level}
```

### 2. Write domain-physics.yaml

Use the template from `modules/algebra-level-1/domain-physics.yaml` as a starting point. Your YAML must conform to [`../standards/domain-physics-schema-v1.json`](../standards/domain-physics-schema-v1.json).

### 3. Validate and convert to JSON

```bash
python ../reference-implementations/yaml-to-json-converter.py \
  domain-packs/{org}/{subject-level}/domain-physics.yaml \
  --schema ../standards/domain-physics-schema-v1.json
```

### 4. Write the entity profile template

Use the profile template from an existing pack as a base (for example, `student-profile-template.yaml` in the education pack, or a domain-equivalent name in your pack). The template defines the initial state for new entities.

### 5. Write tool adapters (if needed)

For each external tool, write a tool adapter YAML conforming to [`../standards/tool-adapter-schema-v1.json`](../standards/tool-adapter-schema-v1.json). Tool adapters are **active verifiers** called by the orchestrator on specific resolved actions. They do not compute gate signals — that is the runtime adapter's job.

### 6. Write a CHANGELOG.md

Document every version with semver, date, and changes.

### 7. Commit the hash to the System Logs

```bash
python ../reference-implementations/system-log-validator.py \
  --commit domain-packs/{org}/{subject-level}/domain-physics.json \
  --actor-id <pseudonymous-id> \
  --ledger path/to/ledger.jsonl
```

Every material module policy change requires:
- semantic version update,
- YAML -> JSON regeneration,
- System Log commitment of the updated module `domain-physics.json` hash before activation.

### 8. Implement your runtime adapter

Create `controllers/runtime_adapters.py` with an `interpret_turn_input` function. This is the synthesis layer where:
- **Phase A** — an optional NLP pre-interpreter extracts deterministic signals from raw input before the LLM prompt is assembled
- **Phase B** — at the end of the function, engine contract fields (`problem_solved`, `problem_status`) are computed from domain-owned evidence

See [`docs/7-concepts/domain-adapter-pattern.md`](../docs/7-concepts/domain-adapter-pattern.md) for the step-by-step template, engine contract field catalogue, and worked examples for both single-step and multi-step task domains.

## Domain Pack Lifecycle

```
Draft → Validated → Committed (System Log) → Active
                                         ↓
                                    New Version (Major/Minor/Patch)
                                         ↓
                                    Validated → Committed → Active
```

A domain pack must be in the `Active` state (System Log commitment present) before use in a production session.

---

## Domain-Lib vs Tool-Adapters

Each domain pack may contain two distinct component types. Understanding the distinction is essential for correct authoring.

### Domain-Lib (Passive Specifications)

The `domain-lib/` folder holds **passive reference documents** — specifications, estimation models, threshold tables, and subsystem profiles that the orchestrator and LLM *read* but never *execute*.

Examples:
- A ZPD monitor specification that defines zone boundaries and drift thresholds
- A fatigue estimation model describing decay curves and recovery windows
- A pH sensor profile specifying operating ranges and tolerance bands

Domain-lib files have **no callable entry point**. They are consumed by the LLM as context or by the orchestrator as configuration lookup. They describe *what* the domain measures, not *how* to compute it.

`world-sim/` content is a separate optional layer for interaction framing. It is not the source of normative thresholds or standing-order policy.

### Tool-Adapters (Active Deterministic Tools)

The `tool-adapters/` folder holds **active tools** — deterministic functions that accept structured input and produce structured output. Each tool has a YAML adapter specification conforming to [`../standards/tool-adapter-schema-v1.json`](../standards/tool-adapter-schema-v1.json), plus a backing implementation (typically in `reference-implementations/tool-adapters.py`).

Examples:
- An algebra parser that tokenises student work into steps and checks algebraic equivalence
- A substitution checker that plugs a value into an equation and returns pass/fail
- A unit-conversion calculator that converts between measurement systems

Tool-adapters are **called by the orchestrator** (or by the turn interpreter on behalf of the orchestrator). They provide ground-truth signals that the LLM cannot fabricate. The LLM should validate its reasoning against tool-adapter output, not the other way around.

Domain-lib runtime components consume structured tool outputs and produce machine-readable state summaries. The orchestrator then enforces module invariants, standing orders, and escalation triggers defined in module `domain-physics.json`.

Tool adapters should be explicitly linked from module `domain-physics` using `tool_adapters` IDs so tooling and governance can verify that only authorized tools are used for that module's physics.
Repository integrity checks enforce this linkage: a declared `tool_adapters` ID must resolve to a concrete adapter contract file in the module.

### When to use which

| Question | Domain-Lib | Tool-Adapter |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| Does it have a callable function? | No | Yes |
| Does it produce deterministic output? | N/A | Yes |
| Is it a specification or reference? | Yes | No |
| Does the orchestrator invoke it? | No (reads only) | Yes |
| Does it conform to tool-adapter-schema? | No | Yes |

---

## Execution Flow Contract

The authoritative execution flow is:

1. Module `domain-physics.json` is loaded as machine-authoritative policy truth.
2. Its hash is verified against the committed System Log `CommitmentRecord`.
3. Authorized tool-adapters produce structured signals/evidence.
4. Domain-lib runtime components transform those signals into machine-readable state summaries.
5. Orchestrator evaluates module invariants and resolves standing-order/escalation outcomes.
6. System Log records are appended for accountability.

`world-sim/` may shape interaction framing, but it does not define normative thresholds, standing-order policy, or escalation policy.

---

## Conformance

All domain packs in this directory must conform to:
- [`../standards/lumina-core-v1.md`](../standards/lumina-core-v1.md) — Section 1
- [`../standards/domain-physics-schema-v1.json`](../standards/domain-physics-schema-v1.json) — JSON Schema

YAML authoring constraint:
- The minimal `reference-implementations/yaml-loader.py` parser cannot reliably parse inline list mappings that mix nested keys on the same list item. Prefer explicit nested mapping blocks and plain string lists in `runtime-config.yaml` and `domain-physics.yaml`.

Packs that fail validation are not usable.

## Available Domains

| Domain | Pack | Version | Status |
|--------|------|---------|--------|
| Education — Algebra Level 1 | `education/modules/algebra-level-1` | 0.4.0 | Active |
| Agriculture | `agriculture/` | — | Placeholder |

---

## Required Domain Layout

Each top-level domain folder should include a `README.md` that defines or links:
- Domain principles
- Domain rules/invariants authority
- Domain state model (schemas + estimators/sensors)
- Domain physics and standing-order vocabulary
