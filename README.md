# Project Lumina

**Bounded, accountable AI orchestration — architecture specifications and reference implementations.**

---

## Vision

Project Lumina builds AI orchestration systems that are **domain-bounded**, **measurement-not-surveillance**, and **accountable at every level**. Every interaction is governed by an explicit Domain Physics ruleset, every decision is traceable via the Casual Trace Ledger, and every authority level is clearly defined.

---

## The D.S.A. Engine & Traceable Accountability

Project Lumina operates on **Dynamic Prompt Contracts** — every AI interaction is strictly bound by the D.S.A. Framework. Rather than issuing a generic prompt, the orchestrator assembles a contract from three pillars, and the AI may only act within what that contract authorizes.

| Pillar | Name | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **D** | **Domain (The Rules)** | The immutable ruleset authored by a human Domain Authority (e.g., a teacher, doctor, or coach). Defines strict invariants, standing orders, artifacts, and escalation triggers. |
| **S** | **State (The Context)** | The mutable, mathematically compressed profile of the entity being observed at the exact time of the request. Includes current affect, mastery, challenge band, and cognitive load. |
| **A** | **Action (The Boundary)** | The specific, highly constrained task the orchestrator is permitted to execute, based exclusively on the active Domain and State. The AI may only do what the Domain authorizes. |

The Domain is authored by the **Domain Authority** (the human expert: teacher, doctor, coach). The State is updated incrementally from structured evidence. The Action layer is bounded: it may only do what the Domain authorizes.

See [`specs/dsa-framework-v1.md`](specs/dsa-framework-v1.md) for the full specification.

### Eliminating Hallucinations via the Casual Trace Ledger (CTL)

Because the AI is handed a strict D.S.A. contract rather than a generic prompt, deviations become **structurally traceable**. The contract defines exactly what the AI was authorized to do — any output outside those bounds is an identifiable violation, not an ambiguous mistake.

The **CTL** is the append-only, cryptographic accountability layer that makes this traceability permanent:

- **Diagnosis, Not Surveillance** — the ledger never stores raw chat transcripts or PII at rest. It stores only hashes and structured decision telemetry.
- **Trace Events** — every decision is logged as a `TraceEvent` capturing the exact `event_type`, the structured `evidence_summary`, and the specific `decision`.
- **Hard Escalations** — if the AI violates a critical invariant or cannot stabilize the session, it halts and generates an `EscalationRecord` with the exact `trigger` and `decision_trail_hashes`.

See [`standards/casual-trace-ledger-v1.md`](standards/casual-trace-ledger-v1.md) and [`ledger/`](ledger/) for schemas.

## Governance Model

Project Lumina uses a **fractal authority structure**: every level is a Domain Authority for its own scope, and a Meta Authority for levels below. This is a generic pattern that applies to any domain.

```
Macro Authority    (e.g., Corporate Policy / Hospital Admin / School Board)
    ↓ Meta Authority for ↓
Meso Authority     (e.g., Site Manager / Dept Head / Curriculum Director)
    ↓ Meta Authority for ↓
Micro Authority    (e.g., Operator / Lead Physician / Teacher)
    ↓ Meta Authority for ↓
Subject/Target     (e.g., Environment / Patient / Learner)
```

Education is one instantiation of this pattern (Administration → Department Head → Teacher → Student). Agriculture (Corporate Policy → Site Manager → Operator → Environment) and medical (Hospital Admin → Department Head → Physician → Patient) are others.

Each level:
- Authors its own **Domain Physics** (YAML → JSON, version-controlled)
- Retrieves context from the level above via **RAG contracts**
- Is held accountable via the **Casual Trace Ledger (CTL)**
- Can escalate upward when the system cannot stabilize

See [`GOVERNANCE.md`](GOVERNANCE.md) for governance policies and [`governance/`](governance/) for templates and role definitions.

## Key Principles

### Universal (Core Engine — apply to every domain)

1. **Domain-bounded operation** — the AI may not act outside what the Domain Physics authorizes
2. **Measurement, not surveillance** — structured telemetry only; no transcript storage
3. **Append-only accountability** — the ledger is never modified, only extended
4. **Domain Authority is the authority** — AI assists, it does not replace the human expert
5. **Do not expand scope without drift justification** — scope creep is a violation
6. **Interests affect generation, never grading** — subject preferences may not influence assessment
7. **Pseudonymity by default** — the AI layer never knows the subject's real identity

### Domain-Specific (Context-Dependent — activated by domain pack configuration)

8. **Consent and boundaries first** — activated when `requires_consent: true`; the interaction boundary must be established before any session begins
9. **Minimal probing** — activated when `zpd_config` is present; one probe per drift detection; do not interrogate
10. **Fade support as self-correction grows** — activated when mastery tracking is present; scaffolding reduces as mastery increases

See [`specs/principles-v1.md`](specs/principles-v1.md) for the full specification.
