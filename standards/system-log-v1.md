# System Logs — V1 Specification

**Version:** 1.1.0
**Status:** Active
**Last updated:** 2026-03-15

---

## Overview

The **System Logs** is the append-only accountability layer for all Project Lumina sessions. It records what happened and what the system decided — not what was said.

**Core constraint:** The System Logs does not store transcripts. It stores structured decision telemetry, hashes of content, and pointers to external (encrypted, ephemeral) stores.

The System Logs exists for diagnosis, not accusation. Its purpose is to enable:
- Post-hoc audit of system decisions
- Escalation packet assembly
- Domain Authority review of session outcomes
- Compliance verification

---

## Design Principles

1. **Append-only**: Records are never modified or deleted. Corrections are new records that reference the prior record.
2. **Hash-chained**: Each record includes the SHA-256 hash of the previous record in the ledger, enabling tamper detection.
3. **No transcripts at rest**: Raw conversation content is never written to the System Logs. Content-bearing fields store hashes + pointers only.
4. **Pseudonymous**: Actor identifiers are pseudonymous tokens. Real-identity mapping is held by the institution in a separate, access-controlled system.
5. **Structured telemetry only**: All values in System Log records are machine-parseable structured fields.

## Record Types

### 1. CommitmentRecord

Records a deliberate commitment by a Domain Authority (human or system acting under explicit authorization).

```json
{
  "record_type": "CommitmentRecord",
  "record_id": "<uuid>",
  "prev_record_hash": "<sha256-hex>",
  "timestamp_utc": "<ISO-8601>",
  "actor_id": "<pseudonymous-token>",
  "actor_role": "domain_authority | meta_authority | orchestrator",
  "commitment_type": "domain_pack_activation | policy_change | escalation_resolution | session_open | session_close",
  "subject_id": "<uuid-of-subject-domain-pack-or-session>",
  "subject_version": "<semver>",
  "subject_hash": "<sha256-hex-of-subject-content>",
  "summary": "<human-readable one-line description>",
  "metadata": {}
}
```

**When to emit:**
- Domain pack activated (first use after version change)
- Policy change committed by Meta Authority
- Escalation resolved by Meta Authority
- Session opened or closed

---

### 2. TraceEvent

Records a single decision or observation during an active session.

```json
{
  "record_type": "TraceEvent",
  "record_id": "<uuid>",
  "prev_record_hash": "<sha256-hex>",
  "timestamp_utc": "<ISO-8601>",
  "session_id": "<uuid>",
  "actor_id": "<pseudonymous-token>",
  "event_type": "invariant_check | standing_order_applied | state_drift_detected | probe_issued | state_update | tool_call | outcome_recorded",
  "invariant_id": "<string | null>",
  "standing_order_id": "<string | null>",
  "decision": "<string>",
  "evidence_summary": {
    "_domain": "<domain-physics-id>",
    "_schema_version": "<semver>",
    "response_latency_sec": "<float | null>",
    "off_task_ratio": "<float | null>",
    "...": "<domain-specific fields declared in evidence-schema.json>"
  },
  "state_snapshot_hash": "<sha256-hex-of-compressed-state>",
  "metadata": {}
}
```

`evidence_summary` uses a standard envelope format. The keys `_domain` and `_schema_version` are reserved. `response_latency_sec` and `off_task_ratio` are universal base fields expected from all domains. All other fields are domain-owned and declared in the module's `evidence-schema.json`. See **[Domain Evidence Extensions](#domain-evidence-extensions)** and [`standards/domain-evidence-extension-v1.md`](domain-evidence-extension-v1.md) for the complete specification.

**When to emit:**
- Invariant check result (pass or fail)
- Standing order applied
- State drift detected
- Probe issued to subject
- State update committed
- Tool called and returned
- Outcome recorded (task completed)

---

### 3. ToolCallRecord

Records a single external tool invocation.

```json
{
  "record_type": "ToolCallRecord",
  "record_id": "<uuid>",
  "prev_record_hash": "<sha256-hex>",
  "timestamp_utc": "<ISO-8601>",
  "session_id": "<uuid>",
  "tool_adapter_id": "<string>",
  "tool_adapter_version": "<semver>",
  "call_type": "<string>",
  "input_hash": "<sha256-hex-of-structured-input>",
  "output_hash": "<sha256-hex-of-structured-output>",
  "success": "<boolean>",
  "latency_ms": "<int>",
  "metadata": {}
}
```

**When to emit:**
- Any call to an external tool adapter

---

### 4. OutcomeRecord

Records the outcome of a task or artifact attempt.

```json
{
  "record_type": "OutcomeRecord",
  "record_id": "<uuid>",
  "prev_record_hash": "<sha256-hex>",
  "timestamp_utc": "<ISO-8601>",
  "session_id": "<uuid>",
  "subject_id": "<pseudonymous-token>",
  "task_id": "<string>",
  "task_version": "<semver>",
  "outcome": "pass | partial | fail | abandoned",
  "mastery_delta": {"<skill_id>": "<float>"},
  "artifact_earned": "<artifact_id | null>",
  "evidence_summary_hash": "<sha256-hex>",
  "metadata": {}
}
```

**When to emit:**
- Task or artifact attempt concluded

---

### 5. EscalationRecord

Records an escalation event — when the orchestrator could not stabilize and passed control upward.

```json
{
  "record_type": "EscalationRecord",
  "record_id": "<uuid>",
  "prev_record_hash": "<sha256-hex>",
  "timestamp_utc": "<ISO-8601>",
  "session_id": "<uuid>",
  "escalating_actor_id": "<pseudonymous-token>",
  "target_meta_authority_id": "<pseudonymous-token>",
  "trigger": "<string>",
  "trigger_standing_order_id": "<string | null>",
  "evidence_summary": {},
  "decision_trail_hashes": ["<sha256>"],
  "proposed_action": "<string | null>",
  "resolution_commitment_id": "<uuid | null>",
  "status": "pending | resolved | timed_out",
  "metadata": {}
}
```

**When to emit:**
- Orchestrator exhausts all standing orders without stabilization
- Critical invariant is violated and no standing order covers it
- State drift is major and unresolved

---

## Domain Evidence Extensions

The `evidence_summary` field in `TraceEvent` and `EscalationRecord` uses a standard envelope format defined in [`standards/domain-evidence-extension-v1.md`](domain-evidence-extension-v1.md). Key points:

**Envelope layout:**

| Key | Reserved? | Description |
|-----|-----------|-------------|
| `_domain` | Yes | Domain physics ID that produced this record |
| `_schema_version` | Yes | Version of the domain's `evidence-schema.json` |
| `response_latency_sec` | No (universal base) | Turn response latency in seconds |
| `off_task_ratio` | No (universal base) | Fraction of response off-task (0.0–1.0) |
| *domain fields* | No (domain-owned) | Declared in the module's `evidence-schema.json` |

**Domain declarations:** Each domain module declares its evidence field vocabulary in an `evidence-schema.json` file placed alongside its `domain-physics.json`. The `domain-physics` file references it via `evidence_schema.path`. The meta-schema that all `evidence-schema.json` files must conform to is [`standards/domain-evidence-schema-v1.json`](domain-evidence-schema-v1.json).

**Schema enforcement:** The core System Log JSON Schema (`ledger/trace-event-schema.json`) accepts any object or null for `evidence_summary` — it does not enforce individual field names. Domain-level field validation is performed offline by audit tooling using the declared `evidence-schema.json`.

---

## Hash Chaining

The first record in a ledger uses `"prev_record_hash": "genesis"`. Each subsequent record sets `prev_record_hash` to the SHA-256 hex digest of the full JSON serialization of the previous record (canonical JSON: keys sorted, no whitespace).

To verify the chain:

```python
import hashlib, json

def canonical(record: dict) -> bytes:
    return json.dumps(record, sort_keys=True, separators=(',', ':')).encode('utf-8')

def verify_chain(records: list) -> bool:
    for i, record in enumerate(records):
        if i == 0:
            assert record['prev_record_hash'] == 'genesis'
        else:
            expected = hashlib.sha256(canonical(records[i-1])).hexdigest()
            if record['prev_record_hash'] != expected:
                return False
    return True
```

---

## Privacy Requirements

- **No raw text**: Content fields must use hashes + external pointers, not inline text
- **Pseudonymous IDs only**: `actor_id`, `subject_id` are pseudonymous tokens
- **Evidence summary only**: `evidence_summary` uses a standard envelope with domain-owned structured fields (response_latency_sec, off_task_ratio, plus domain-specific fields) and never quotes from the subject. See [`standards/domain-evidence-extension-v1.md`](domain-evidence-extension-v1.md).
- **Mastery deltas only**: `mastery_delta` records how mastery changed, not what was said

---

## Retention Policy

System Log records are retained for the duration of the institution's data retention policy, as set by the Meta Authority. Minimum retention is 90 days for audit purposes. The System Logs may be archived but not deleted during the retention window.

## Universal Event Payload & Micro-Routing

As of v1.1.0 all System Log writes are also emitted as **Universal Event Payloads** through the System Log Micro-Router.  The payload is a `LogEvent` envelope that wraps any operational or audit-level event:

| Field       | Type              | Description                                                     |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `timestamp` | `str`             | ISO-8601 UTC timestamp.                                         |
| `source`    | `str`             | Emitting module (e.g. `system_log_writer`, `ppa_orchestrator`). |
| `level`     | `LogLevel`        | Routing tier: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL, AUDIT.     |
| `category`  | `str`             | Free-form tag for subscriber filtering.                         |
| `message`   | `str`             | Human-readable summary.                                         |
| `data`      | `dict`            | Arbitrary structured payload.                                   |
| `record`    | `dict` or `None`  | Hash-chained System Log record when `level` is AUDIT.           |

### Routing Levels

| Level            | Destination                                     |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| DEBUG, INFO      | Rolling archive log files                       |
| WARNING          | Admin dashboard queue (bounded in-memory store) |
| ERROR, CRITICAL  | Persistent error log + Chat UI alert queue      |
| AUDIT            | Observation only — the hash-chained ledger write is performed by `SystemLogWriter` before the event reaches the bus |

The AUDIT level is the bridge between operational logging and the immutable audit ledger.  `SystemLogWriter` remains the hash authority: it chains and persists the record, then emits an AUDIT event so secondary consumers can observe the write without touching the ledger files.

### Event Categories

The `category` tag enables fine-grained subscriber filtering.  Registered categories:

| Category | Source Module | Description |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `invariant_check` | PPAOrchestrator | Invariant evaluation results |
| `session_lifecycle` | PPAOrchestrator | Session open/close/turn events |
| `hash_chain` | SystemLogWriter | Audit ledger writes |
| `inference_parsing` | slm_ppa_worker | SLM enrichment results |
| `rbac_change` | RBAC layer | Role or permission mutations |
| `admin_command` | Admin handler | Admin command execution |
| `daemon_lifecycle` | ResourceMonitorDaemon | Daemon start/stop/state transitions |
| `daemon_dispatch` | ResourceMonitorDaemon | Opportunistic task dispatch and completion |
| `daemon_preemption` | ResourceMonitorDaemon | Cooperative preemption events |
