# Domain Profile Specification — V1

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Status:** Active  
**Last updated:** 2026-03-02

---

## Overview

A **Domain Profile** (also called a **Domain Pack**) bounds a Project Lumina system to a specific subject area and operating context. This document specifies how to author a Domain Profile, what it must contain, and how it is activated.

---

## What a Domain Profile Does

A Domain Profile:
1. **Defines what is correct** — invariants specify the rules of the domain
2. **Defines what the system may do** — standing orders bound the orchestrator's automated responses
3. **Defines when to escalate** — escalation triggers specify when human intervention is needed
4. **Defines what mastery means** — artifacts specify achievable outcomes
5. **Sets subsystem parameters** — `subsystem_configs` provides domain-specific configuration for subsystems such as an education drift monitor or a soil-health monitor

A Domain Profile does not define conversation scripts, specific problem sets, or lesson plans. Those are content, not structure. The profile governs the structure.

---

## Authoring Process

### Step 1: Author the YAML

Write `domain-physics.yaml` following the structure below. The YAML is the source of truth — human-readable and version-controlled.

```yaml
id: domain/org/subject-level/v1
version: "0.1.0"

domain_authority:
  name: "Jane Smith"
  role: "Lead Algebra Teacher"

meta_authority_id: domain/org/curriculum/v1

description: "Algebra Level 1 domain pack"

lumina_core_version: "1.0.0"

invariants:
  - id: equivalence_preserved
    description: "Both sides of an equation must remain equal after each step"
    severity: critical
    check: "verify_algebraic_equivalence(before_step, after_step)"
    standing_order_on_violation: request_more_steps

standing_orders:
  - id: request_more_steps
    action: request_more_steps
    trigger_condition: equivalence_preserved
    max_attempts: 3
    escalation_on_exhaust: true
    description: "Request explicit step-by-step work evidence"

escalation_triggers:
  - id: critical_invariant_unresolvable
    condition: "critical invariant violated and standing order exhausted"
    target_role: teacher
    sla_minutes: 30

artifacts:
  - id: linear_equations_basic
    name: "Linear Equations — Foundations"
    unlock_condition: "mastery >= 0.8 on solve_one_variable"
    mastery_threshold: 0.8
    skills_required:
      - solve_one_variable

subsystem_configs:
  zpd_monitor:
    min_challenge: 0.3
    max_challenge: 0.7
    drift_window_turns: 10
    minor_drift_threshold: 0.3
    major_drift_threshold: 0.5
    persistence_required: 3
```

### Step 2: Validate and Convert

Run the converter to validate and produce the JSON:

```bash
python reference-implementations/yaml-to-json-converter.py \
  domain-packs/education/modules/algebra-level-1/domain-physics.yaml \
  --schema standards/domain-physics-schema-v1.json
```

If validation passes, the JSON file is written alongside the YAML.

### Step 3: Commit the Hash

Before the domain pack is used operationally, commit its hash to the System Logs:

```bash
python reference-implementations/system-log-validator.py \
  --commit domain-packs/education/modules/algebra-level-1/domain-physics.json \
  --actor-id <pseudonymous-id> \
  --ledger path/to/ledger.jsonl
```

This writes a `CommitmentRecord` to the ledger. The hash in the `CommitmentRecord` must match the hash of the JSON file at session time.

### Step 4: Write a CHANGELOG Entry

Every version must have a CHANGELOG entry. Format:

```markdown
## v0.2.0 — 2026-03-02
### Added
- ZPD configuration with drift thresholds (education domain example)
- `zpd_drift_minor` and `zpd_drift_major` warning invariants (education domain example)
### Changed
- `show_work_minimum` max_attempts increased from 2 to 3
```

## Invariant Design Guidelines

**DO:**
- Write invariants that can be checked deterministically (not by reading conversation tone)
- Make critical invariants correspond to observable, verifiable properties
- Pair every critical invariant with a standing order
- Set `max_attempts` conservatively — err on the side of escalating sooner
- Use `handled_by` to delegate invariants that are evaluated by a domain-specific subsystem (see below)

**DON'T:**
- Write invariants that require the system to infer intent or emotion
- Create invariants that have no corresponding standing order
- Set `max_attempts` so high that the system loops forever before escalating
- Use conversation content as the basis for invariant checks

### Delegating Invariants with `handled_by`

Some invariants are evaluated by a domain-specific subsystem rather than by the orchestrator's built-in `check` expression evaluator. Set `handled_by` to the subsystem ID to delegate evaluation:

```yaml
- id: zpd_drift_minor
  description: "Challenge level drifted outside band in >= 30% of recent window turns"
  severity: warning
  check: "outside_pct >= 0.3"   # optional — informational documentation
  handled_by: zpd_monitor        # orchestrator skips its own check; subsystem decides
  standing_order_on_violation: zpd_scaffold
```

When `handled_by` is present:
- The orchestrator skips evaluating the `check` expression for this invariant.
- The named subsystem is responsible for detecting the condition and returning a decision.
- The `check` field is optional but recommended as human-readable documentation.

This mechanism is **domain-agnostic**: the orchestrator never needs to know invariant IDs by name. An agriculture domain can define `soil_moisture_drift_minor` with `handled_by: soil_health_monitor` using the same pattern, and the engine will delegate it correctly without any engine-level changes.

---

## Subsystem Configuration Guidelines

Domain-specific subsystems (such as the ZPD monitor in education domains, or a soil-health monitor in agriculture domains) declare their parameters under `subsystem_configs`, keyed by subsystem ID. This keeps domain-specific vocabulary out of the universal schema.

**Education example — ZPD monitor configuration:**

The `subsystem_configs.zpd_monitor` block should be set based on the Domain Authority's domain-specific judgment:

- **Too narrow**: frequent drift, too many interventions
- **Too wide**: drift goes undetected, the subject may struggle or disengage

Typical starting values:
- `min_challenge: 0.25` (25th percentile of current mastery)
- `max_challenge: 0.75` (75th percentile — stretch but achievable)
- `drift_window_turns: 10`
- `minor_drift_threshold: 0.3` (3 of 10 turns outside ZPD → minor)
- `major_drift_threshold: 0.5` (5 of 10 turns outside ZPD → major)
- `persistence_required: 3`

Other domains should define their own subsystem config blocks under `subsystem_configs` using keys and parameter names appropriate to their domain (e.g. `subsystem_configs.soil_health_monitor`).

---

## Multi-Domain Sessions

A session may span multiple Domain Profiles if the Meta Authority authorizes it. In this case:
- Each domain has its own invariant set
- The session's escalation policy is the union of both domains' escalation triggers
- The System Logs records which domain was active for each TraceEvent

Multi-domain sessions are advanced usage and require explicit Meta Authority approval in the session's CommitmentRecord.

---

## Access Control

Every domain-physics document must include a `permissions` block that controls who can read, write, and execute the module. Permissions follow a UNIX chmod-style octal model.

### Permission Block

```yaml
permissions:
  mode: "750"                          # rwxr-x---
  owner: "da_algebra_lead_001"         # pseudonymous_id of owning Domain Authority
  group: "domain_authority"            # role receiving group-level bits
  acl:                                 # optional extended ACL
    - role: qa
      access: rx
      scope: evaluation_only
    - role: auditor
      access: r
      scope: log_records_only
    - role: user
      access: x
```

### Permission Bits

| Bit | Value | Meaning |
|-----|-------|---------|
| r | 4 | Read domain physics, session data, System Log records |
| w | 2 | Author or modify domain packs, invariants, standing orders |
| x | 1 | Run sessions, trigger tool adapters |

The runtime resolves each authenticated user against the module's owner, group, and others categories, then checks the corresponding octal digit for the required permission bit. `root` bypasses all checks.

### Runtime Config Access Control

The runtime configuration (`runtime-config.yaml`) may also declare an `access_control` block listing which roles may use the module at runtime:

```yaml
access_control:
  required_role: user
  allowed_roles:
    - root
    - domain_authority
    - it_support
    - qa
    - user
```

For the full access control specification, see [`rbac-spec-v1.md`](rbac-spec-v1.md).
