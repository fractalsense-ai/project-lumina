## Overview

Domain Role Hierarchy is an extension to Lumina's RBAC system that allows each domain to define its own role tiers beneath the Domain Authority ceiling. While the 7 system-level roles (`root`, `domain_authority`, `it_support`, `qa`, `auditor`, `user`, `guest`) provide coarse-grained access control across the entire system, domain roles provide fine-grained access control *within* a specific domain.

**Problem:** In an education deployment, a department head (Domain Authority), teachers, teaching assistants, and students all need different levels of access to the same domain module. The system-level `user` role treats them all identically. An enterprise deployment has the same challenge with managers, team leads, and employees.

**Solution:** Each domain-physics document can declare an optional `domain_roles` block that defines a hierarchy of roles scoped to that domain. These roles integrate with the existing JWT and permission resolution system as an additive overlay.

## Design Principles

1. **Additive overlay** — System roles are the base layer. Domain roles refine access within a domain but never exceed the ceiling set by the system role they map to.

2. **DA is always the ceiling** — The Domain Authority is implicitly hierarchy level 0 within their domain. No domain role can grant more access than the DA has. Domain roles start at hierarchy level 1.

3. **Backward-compatible** — The `domain_roles` block is optional. Domains without it work exactly as before. Domain roles are purely additive.

4. **Domain-scoped** — A domain role exists only within its domain. A user can be a `teacher` in algebra and a `student` in geometry. There is no cross-domain inheritance.

## How It Works

### Defining Domain Roles

Domain roles are declared in the `domain_roles` block of a domain-physics document:

```json
{
  "domain_roles": {
    "schema_version": "1.0",
    "roles": [
      {
        "role_id": "teacher",
        "role_name": "Teacher",
        "hierarchy_level": 1,
        "description": "Instructor with full domain access.",
        "maps_to_system_role": "domain_authority",
        "default_access": "rwx",
        "may_assign_domain_roles": true,
        "max_assignable_level": 2,
        "scoped_capabilities": {
          "receive_escalations": true,
          "view_all_student_progress": true
        }
      },
      {
        "role_id": "teaching_assistant",
        "role_name": "Teaching Assistant",
        "hierarchy_level": 2,
        "description": "Support staff with read and execute access.",
        "maps_to_system_role": "user",
        "default_access": "rx"
      },
      {
        "role_id": "student",
        "role_name": "Student",
        "hierarchy_level": 3,
        "description": "Learner with execute-only access.",
        "maps_to_system_role": "user",
        "default_access": "x"
      }
    ],
    "role_acl": [
      {
        "domain_role": "teaching_assistant",
        "access": "r",
        "scope": "ctl_records_own_students"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Role Definition Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `role_id` | yes | Unique identifier within the domain (lowercase_snake_case) |
| `role_name` | yes | Human-readable display name |
| `hierarchy_level` | yes | Position in hierarchy (1-10, DA is implicit 0) |
| `description` | yes | Purpose and responsibilities |
| `maps_to_system_role` | yes | System role ceiling (`domain_authority`, `user`, or `guest`) |
| `default_access` | yes | Default `rwxi` permissions within the domain |
| `may_assign_domain_roles` | no | Can this role assign domain roles to others? (default: false) |
| `max_assignable_level` | no | Lowest privilege level this role can assign (only when `may_assign_domain_roles` is true) |
| `scoped_capabilities` | no | Free-form boolean flags for domain-specific capability checks |

### System Role Mapping

Each domain role maps to a system role via `maps_to_system_role`. This determines the maximum possible permissions the domain role can be granted:

| System Role | Use For | Ceiling |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| `domain_authority` | Sub-DA roles like teachers, managers | Full rwx possible |
| `user` | Operational roles like TAs, field operators | Based on module ACL |
| `guest` | Limited-access domain roles | Read and/or execute only |

Cross-cutting system roles (`root`, `it_support`, `qa`, `auditor`) cannot be used as mappings because they have independent system-wide scope.

### JWT Integration

Domain roles are carried in the JWT as a `domain_roles` claim mapping module IDs to role IDs:

```json
{
  "sub": "user_ta_001",
  "role": "user",
  "governed_modules": [],
  "domain_roles": {
    "domain/edu/algebra-level-1/v1": "teaching_assistant",
    "domain/edu/geometry-level-1/v1": "student"
  }
}
```

A user can hold different domain roles in different modules.

### Permission Resolution

The permission checker runs domain role resolution as step 7, after all system-level checks:

```
1. Root bypass                                    → ALLOW
2-5. System-level mode check (owner/group/others) → ALLOW if permitted
6. System-level ACL check                         → ALLOW if permitted
7. Domain role check                              → ALLOW if permitted
   a. Look up domain_role in domain_roles.roles
   b. Check default_access for the operation
   c. Check role_acl entries for the domain_role
   d. Check permissions.acl for domain_role entries
8. DENY
```

Domain roles are purely additive. They can grant access that the system role alone would deny, but they cannot revoke access already granted by system-level checks.

## Domain Examples

### Education

| Domain Role | Level | System Mapping | Access | Description |
|-------------|-------|----------------|--------|-------------|
| *(Domain Authority)* | *0* | *domain_authority* | *rwx* | Department head — implicit ceiling |
| `teacher` | 1 | `domain_authority` | rwx | Instructor, receives escalations, can assign TAs and students |
| `teaching_assistant` | 2 | `user` | rx | Support staff, can view student progress and issue hints |
| `student` | 3 | `user` | x | Learner, execute sessions only |

### Agriculture

| Domain Role | Level | System Mapping | Access | Description |
|-------------|-------|----------------|--------|-------------|
| *(Domain Authority)* | *0* | *domain_authority* | *rwx* | Lead operations manager — implicit ceiling |
| `site_manager` | 1 | `domain_authority` | rwx | On-site manager, can assign operators and observers |
| `field_operator` | 2 | `user` | rx | Field workers who execute procedures and log observations |
| `observer` | 3 | `user` | r | Read-only observers |

### Enterprise (Example)

| Domain Role | Level | System Mapping | Access | Description |
|-------------|-------|----------------|--------|-------------|
| *(Domain Authority)* | *0* | *domain_authority* | *rwx* | VP / Director — implicit ceiling |
| `manager` | 1 | `domain_authority` | rwx | Department managers |
| `team_lead` | 2 | `user` | rx | Team leads with monitoring access |
| `employee` | 3 | `user` | x | Standard employees |

### Healthcare (Example)

| Domain Role | Level | System Mapping | Access | Description |
|-------------|-------|----------------|--------|-------------|
| *(Domain Authority)* | *0* | *domain_authority* | *rwx* | Chief physician — implicit ceiling |
| `attending_physician` | 1 | `domain_authority` | rwx | Lead physician with full clinical authority |
| `resident` | 2 | `domain_authority` | rx | Physicians in training |
| `nurse` | 3 | `user` | rx | Nursing staff |
| `patient` | 4 | `user` | x | Patients in guided interactions |

## Scoped Capabilities

The `scoped_capabilities` field provides domain-specific boolean flags that go beyond the `rwxi` permission model. These are consulted by domain runtime code for fine-grained capability checks:

```json
"scoped_capabilities": {
  "receive_escalations": true,
  "view_all_student_progress": true,
  "modify_standing_orders": false,
  "issue_hints": true
}
```

Capabilities are free-form and domain-defined. They are not enforced by the permission checker itself but by domain-specific code paths (e.g., the escalation engine checks `receive_escalations` to determine who receives escalation packets).

---

## Role Assignment

Domain roles are assigned by the Domain Authority or by roles with `may_assign_domain_roles: true`. Assignments are recorded in the CTL as `domain_role_assignment` commitment records for full auditability.

A role can only assign roles at or below its `max_assignable_level`. For example, a teacher at level 1 with `max_assignable_level: 2` can assign teaching assistants (level 2) and students (level 3) but not other teachers (level 1).
