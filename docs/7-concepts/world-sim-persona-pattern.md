# World-Sim as Domain Persona — Pattern Reference

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** Active
**Last updated:** 2026-03-13

## Overview

Every domain pack can optionally project a **persona** — a narrative identity the AI adopts for the duration of a session. The world simulation (world-sim) is the mechanism that implements this persona. It is a cosmetic framing layer: the narrative changes how domain content is *presented*, never what it *is*.

This document defines the pattern so that any domain pack can adopt it. The education domain is the reference implementation.

---

## The Three-File Composition

A complete world-sim persona is defined by three spec files, owned by the domain:

| File | Role in the Persona |
|---|---|
| `world-sim-spec-v1.md` | **Persona parameters** — theme, setting description, in-world labels for tasks and artifacts, exit phrase, theme selection rules |
| `magic-circle-consent-v1.md` | **Activation gate** — the persona does not turn on until the participant gives informed consent. The consent process is the "magic circle" that marks the boundary between real interaction and immersive framing. |
| `artifact-and-mastery-spec-v1.md` | **Reward surface** — earned milestones (artifacts) may be presented with in-world names. Only the display name is part of the persona; the functional definition (mastery threshold, skills required) is invariant. |

All three files live under `domain-packs/<domain>/world-sim/`.

> **Key principle:** The persona is the skin. The domain physics is the skeleton. The skeleton never changes because the skin does.

## Static vs. Dynamic Persona

### Static Persona

The domain pack declares a single fixed theme in `runtime-config.yaml`. Every session uses the same narrative context regardless of who the participant is.

```yaml
world_sim:
  enabled: true
  default_theme: space_exploration
  themes:
    space_exploration:
      setting_description: "You are the mission mathematician aboard the Helios research vessel."
      artifact_framing: "mission_badge"
      task_framing: "mission_briefing"
      exit_phrase: "end mission"
      preference_keywords: []
```

This is the simplest option. Use it when a domain has a single well-defined narrative context.

### Dynamic Persona

The domain pack declares multiple themes and uses the entity's preference profile to select one at session start. The selection runs once in `build_initial_learning_state` and is stored on the domain state object for the session's duration.

**Selection rules (enforced by `select_world_sim_theme`):**
1. Collect the entity's `preferences.interests` list (and `preferences.likes` as a legacy alias; both are checked).
2. Find the first theme whose `preference_keywords` overlaps with the interests list.
3. Skip any theme whose `preference_keywords` overlaps with the entity's `dislikes` list (dislike always wins over like).
4. Fall back to `default_theme` if no match is found.
5. Return `{}` if `world_sim.enabled` is `false`.

The selected theme config dict is stored as `state.world_sim_theme` and forwarded to `interpret_turn_input` on every turn as a hint block:

```
[World-Sim Active] Setting: <setting_description>.
Use in-world framing ('<task_framing>') for task labels.
Artifact framing: '<artifact_framing>'.
```

Module-level overrides are declared in `domain-physics.yaml` under `world_sim_override` and allow a specific module to restrict available themes or change the default within that module's scope.

## MUD Dynamic World Builder (Education Domain Extension)

The **MUD World Builder** is an advanced dynamic persona pattern implemented on top of the standard theme selection layer. It is currently the education domain's reference implementation of a fully-locked session narrative.

Where the standard Dynamic Persona selects one of a small set of broad themes (e.g., `space_exploration`, `sports_and_games`), the MUD World Builder generates a **World State** — 8 narrative constants that stay identical for the entire session, eliminating narrative drift completely:

| Field | Role |
|---|---|
| `zone` | The session setting; prevents hallucinated environment changes |
| `protagonist` | The student's in-world role |
| `antagonist` | The boss who creates pressure |
| `guide_npc` | The hint character, with a distinct voice |
| `macguffin` | The objective that motivates every equation |
| `variable_skin` | What the algebraic unknown *is* in this world |
| `obstacle_theme` | How equations are physically represented |
| `failure_state` | Exact narrative consequence on any invariant violation |

The same $3x + 5 = 17$ algebra check spawns different narration in each world — but the `equivalence_preserved` invariant fires identically regardless:

- **Dark Fantasy:** *"The counter-weight scale violently tips! Trap triggered! A poison dart strikes you. Lose 10 HP."*
- **Zombie Survival:** *"The elevator sparks! Too much noise! Horde Proximity +15%."*
- **Cyber-Heist:** *"ACCESS DENIED. Security tripped! Alert Level rises."*

### Selection Algorithm

`generate_mud_world(entity_profile, mud_world_cfg)` in `systools/runtime_adapters.py`:

1. Collect `preferences.interests` and `preferences.likes` (both; merged into one set).
2. Collect `preferences.dislikes`.
3. Iterate the template library (in `mud-world-templates.yaml`).
4. Skip any template whose `preference_keywords` overlaps with dislikes.
5. Return first template whose `preference_keywords` overlaps with interests/likes.
6. Fallback: return the first zero-keyword template (`general_math`).

The generated World State is stored as `state.mud_world_state` at session start and injected into every turn's context as a `[MUD World Active]` hint block. The session-open `CommitmentRecord` captures the `template_id` for audit traceability.

### Relationship to Standard Theme Selection

Both systems are active simultaneously. They are complementary, not competing:

- `world_sim_theme` → controls `task_framing`, `artifact_framing`, `exit_phrase` (broad UX labels)
- `mud_world_state` → controls `zone`, `protagonist`, `antagonist`, `guide_npc`, `macguffin`, `variable_skin`, `obstacle_theme`, `failure_state` (session narrative constants)

## Engine Contract Invariant

The world-sim persona never alters what the core engine enforces. The following are preserved regardless of narrative framing:

- Invariant checks run identically in-world and out-of-world
- Mastery thresholds and proficiency calculations are unchanged
- Consent, escalation, and exit clause mechanics are unchanged
- The CTL records functional outcomes, not narrative content
- Assessment is based on verifiable domain outcomes (see `domain-adapter-pattern.md`), never on behavioral inference or narrative engagement

The AI may use in-world language to communicate constraint violations. The underlying check is identical:

> *"Your equation must stay balanced — the mission computer won't accept unbalanced equations"* enforces `equivalence_preserved` exactly as much as *"Your equation is unbalanced"*.

---

## How Other Domains Adopt the Pattern

Any domain pack may add a `world-sim/` folder. The three-file pattern is the template:

| Domain | Example Setting | Artifact Framing | Task Framing |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Education** (ref impl) | `"You are the mission mathematician aboard the Helios research vessel."` | `mission_badge` | `mission_briefing` |
| **Agriculture** (example) | `"You are managing the Thornfield research farm."` | `harvest_record` | `field_task` |
| **Medical** (example) | `"You are on duty at the forward field hospital."` | `clinical_competency_record` | `patient_case` |

The consent spec (`magic-circle-consent-v1.md`) must be adapted for each domain using domain-appropriate participant and authority terminology — the education version refers to "student," "parent/guardian," and "teacher." A medical version would use "patient," "healthcare proxy," and "supervising clinician."

The domain does not need to be dynamic to adopt world-sim. A static fixed theme is a fully valid implementation.

## Configuration Reference

### `runtime-config.yaml` — Domain-wide defaults

```yaml
world_sim:
  enabled: true                     # set to false to disable entirely
  default_theme: general            # used when no preference match is found
  themes:
    <theme_id>:
      setting_description: "..."    # injected as the session context description
      artifact_framing: "..."       # replaces "certificate" / "badge" labels
      task_framing: "..."           # replaces "problem" / "task" labels
      exit_phrase: "..."            # in-world equivalent of "exit session"
      preference_keywords: [...]    # matched against entity profile preferences.likes
```

### `domain-physics.yaml` — Optional per-module override

```yaml
world_sim_override:
  default_theme: space_exploration      # override the domain-wide default for this module
  available_themes:                     # restrict to a subset of domain-wide themes
    - space_exploration
    - general_math
```

If `world_sim_override` is absent, the module inherits the domain-wide `world_sim` config from `runtime-config.yaml`.
