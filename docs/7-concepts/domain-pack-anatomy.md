# Domain Pack Anatomy

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Status:** Active  
**Last updated:** 2026-03-21  

---

A domain pack is the fundamental unit of domain knowledge and bounded authority in Project
Lumina. Understanding what a domain pack *is* — as a design pattern, not just a directory
structure — is the prerequisite for understanding how Lumina separates domain concerns from
system concerns, why every domain owns its own NLP pre-processor, and why the physics file
is the domain's law rather than its executor.

---

## A. What Is a Domain Pack?

A domain pack is the **D pillar** of the D.S.A. Framework (Domain, State, Action). It is a
self-contained unit of domain knowledge, behavioural constraints, and processing tools that
brings a specific subject area — education, agriculture, industrial operations, system
administration — into the Lumina engine as a bounded authority.

The word *bounded* is deliberate. A domain pack does not integrate loosely with the engine;
it declares a closed cognitive sub-system that:

- owns its own **physics** — invariants, standing orders, escalation triggers
- owns its own **tools** — active verifiers for domain-specific propositions
- owns its own **information gate** — an NLP pre-interpreter that defines which signals matter
  in this domain and extracts them deterministically before any LLM inference happens
- owns its own **domain library** — passive state estimators tracking entity state across turns
- owns its own **synthesis layer** — a runtime adapter that computes the engine contract fields
- optionally owns its own **narrative framing** — a world-sim persona for human-facing contexts

The engine (`src/lumina/`) knows nothing about what a domain pack contains. It reads only
the two engine contract fields (`problem_solved`, `problem_status`) that the pack's runtime
adapter emits. Every domain-specific field name, vocabulary term, and computation lives
entirely inside the pack. This is the **self-containment contract** (see §E).

---

## B. The Six Components

Every domain pack is composed of up to six components. Not all are required for a minimal
pack, but all six are present in a fully-realised production pack.

| Component | Location | Who calls it | Mandatory | What it owns |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Physics files** | `modules/<module>/domain-physics.yaml` and `.json` | Core engine at session load | Yes | Invariants (critical/warning), standing orders, escalation triggers, artifact definitions |
| **Tool adapters** | `modules/<module>/tool-adapters/*.yaml` + `systools/tool_adapters.py` | Orchestrator policy system (YAML-declared) or runtime adapter directly (Python) | Recommended | Active, deterministic verifiers — compute domain-specific field values on demand |
| **Runtime adapter** | `systools/runtime_adapters.py` | Core engine on every turn | Yes | Phase A (NLP pre-processing before LLM) + Phase B (signal synthesis after tools); emits engine contract fields |
| **NLP pre-interpreter** | `systools/nlp_pre_interpreter.py` | Core engine before LLM prompt assembly | Yes (all text-input domains) | Deterministic extraction of domain-meaningful signals from raw input; produces `_nlp_anchors` |
| **Domain library** | `domain-lib/*.md` specs + `systools/*.py` implementations | Runtime adapter only — never the engine directly | Where applicable | Passive state estimators tracking entity state across turns (ZPD monitor, fluency tracker, fatigue model) |
| **World-sim (optional)** | `world-sim/*.md` + `world-sim/templates.yaml` | Runtime adapter, once at session start | No | Narrative framing layer — cosmetic only; domain physics and invariants are unchanged inside any world-sim theme |

These components are not interchangeable and must not be substituted for one another. The
tool adapters verify; the domain library estimates; the runtime adapter synthesises; the NLP
pre-interpreter gates. Confusing these responsibilities is the most common mistake when
authoring a new domain pack.

---

## C. The Information Gate — Why NLP Runs First

The NLP pre-interpreter is not an optional quality-of-life enhancement. It is the domain's
**information gate** — the domain's assertion that *it defines which signals are meaningful
in this context, and those signals will be extracted with certainty before any probabilistic
LLM inference begins*.

### The rationale

An LLM receiving raw unstructured text will compute its own implicit representations of
that text. If the domain has authoritative prior knowledge about what matters — "in an algebra
session, whether the student's answer is numerically correct is a deterministic fact, not an
inference" — that knowledge must be asserted before the LLM constructs its interpretation.
Otherwise the LLM's representation may diverge from the domain's authoritative view, and
there is no mechanism to detect or correct that divergence.

This is the core reliability contribution of Phase A:

> **Determinism must precede probability.** Anything that can be extracted with certainty
> must be extracted before the uncertain reasoning begins.

The NLP pre-interpreter runs first, produces structured signals, and injects them as
`_nlp_anchors` into the LLM context — explicitly tagged as deterministic. The LLM may
override them; the anchors are priors, not hard constraints at the LLM layer. But given a
deterministic prior, overriding it becomes the exception rather than the rule. Without it,
the LLM is guessing at information the domain already knows.

### What the pre-interpreter produces

The pre-interpreter's entry point (`nlp_preprocess(input_text, task_context) -> dict`)
returns a dict containing:

- Zero or more domain-specific evidence fields (e.g., `correctness`, `extracted_answer`,
  `intent_type`)
- A `_nlp_anchors` list: structured records of each extracted signal, each with `field`,
  `value`, `confidence`, and an optional `detail` string

The anchors are formatted by the runtime adapter into the LLM context hint:

```
NLP pre-analysis (deterministic):
- correctness: correct (confidence: 0.95) — matched answer "4" to expected "x = 4"
- frustration_marker_count: 0
- off_task_ratio: 0.1
Use these as starting values. Override if your analysis disagrees.
```

### Each domain owns its own gate

The NLP pre-interpreter is intentionally per-domain, not shared. The signals meaningful in
an algebra education session (answer correctness, frustration markers, hint requests,
off-task ratio) are entirely different from those meaningful in a system administration
session (mutation vs read intent, target user, target role, compound command detection).
There is no universal pre-interpreter, and there should not be one.

This design ensures that domain boundary violations are structurally impossible at the NLP
layer: a student message cannot accidentally activate system administration signal
extraction, because the pre-interpreter loaded at session start is the education domain's —
registered in `cfg/runtime-config.yaml` as the `nlp_pre_interpreter` adapter for that
session's domain.

For the full two-tier architecture (system-level domain classification → domain NLP
pre-interpreter), see [`nlp-semantic-router(7)`](nlp-semantic-router.md). For the Phase A
implementation contract, anchor injection format, and extractor reference for the education
domain, see [`domain-adapter-pattern(7)`](domain-adapter-pattern.md) §D.

## D. Physics as Standing Orders

A common misreading of domain packs is that the domain physics file *controls* or *executes*
domain behaviour — that declaring an invariant is the same as enforcing it. This is not how
physics files work.

The domain physics file is the domain's **law**, not its **executor**. It declares:

- what must be true (**invariants**)
- what the orchestrator is authorised to do automatically when a constraint is triggered
  (**standing orders**)
- what conditions require Meta Authority intervention (**escalation triggers**)

The orchestrator reads these declarations and decides whether to act on them in the current
context. Physics alone triggers nothing.

### Invariant severity levels

| Severity | Meaning | Automatic response |
|---|---|---|
| `critical` | Violation halts autonomous action | Immediate standing order execution or escalation to Meta Authority |
| `warning` | Violation approaches a defined threshold | Standing order response within the current session; no halt |

### Standing orders are bounded permissions, not scripts

A standing order specifies what the orchestrator *may* do in response to an invariant
condition, bounded by explicit parameters. It is a permission with constraints, not an
execution script. The orchestrator evaluates whether the standing order applies to the
current turn before acting.

**Education domain example:**

```yaml
id: reduce_challenge_on_exhaustion
trigger: max_attempts.attempts_remaining == 0
action: reduce_challenge_tier
parameters:
  reduction_amount: 1
  notify_subject: true
```

This authorises the orchestrator to reduce the challenge tier when attempts are exhausted.
It does not specify the new problem content — that remains a proposal subject to invariant
checking, not an automatic bypass of the normal proposal-validation pipeline.

### Hash commitment

Before a domain physics file becomes active in a session, its hash is committed to the
System Log. This ensures the invariant set cannot change mid-session without an explicit log
record. Any version change to `domain-physics.json` requires a new hash commitment and a
`CHANGELOG.md` entry with a semver increment.

For the physics file's role within the three-stage proposal pipeline (Proposal →
Validation → HITL), and how standing orders interact with the execution gate, see
[`command-execution-pipeline(7)`](command-execution-pipeline.md).

---

## E. The Self-Containment Contract

The self-containment contract is the hard rule that makes domain isolation enforceable and
domain adding zero-impact on the engine:

> **Zero domain-specific names may appear in `src/lumina/`.**

All domain logic, domain field names, domain computations, and domain vocabulary live
exclusively inside the domain pack. The core engine never references `correctness`,
`frustration_marker_count`, `intent_type`, `moisture_level`, or any other domain-specific
name. It reads only `problem_solved` and `problem_status` from the evidence dict returned
by the runtime adapter.

This is what makes it possible to add a new domain pack — radiology, autonomous vehicle
telemetry, industrial process control — without any changes to the engine. The engine will
load the new pack's runtime adapter, call `interpret_turn_input()`, and read the two
contract fields from the returned evidence dict. It does not need to know what the evidence
dict contains beyond those two fields.

### The closed information channel

Each domain pack is a closed information channel. The domain controls what enters and what
exits; the engine observes only the exit:

```
raw input
    │
    ▼
NLP pre-interpreter — domain-owned, pure regex/keyword, no LLM
    │
    ▼
LLM prompt assembly — NLP anchors injected into context
    │
    ▼
LLM inference
    │
    ▼
tool adapters + domain library — domain-owned
    │
    ▼
runtime adapter synthesis — assembles evidence dict
    │
    ▼
engine reads: problem_solved, problem_status
```

At no point does the engine inspect the intermediate stages. Domain-specific field names
travel through the channel but never cross the domain boundary into engine code.

For the engine contract field reference, types, defaults, and worked examples across
education and hypothetical scientific domains, see [`domain-adapter-pattern(7)`](domain-adapter-pattern.md) §B.

## F. Cross-Domain Comparison

The domain pack pattern is universal. What varies between packs is content, not structure.
The three currently active domain packs illustrate this:

| Dimension | `education` | `system` | `agriculture` |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Pre-interpreter extractors** | answer_match, frustration_markers, hint_request, off_task_ratio | admin_verb (mutation/read), target_user, target_role, compound_command, glossary_match | soil sensor thresholds, pest signal keywords, moisture anomaly detection |
| **Physics invariant type** | Pedagogical (max_consecutive_incorrect, zpd_drift_limit, session_fatigue) | Operational security (privilege escalation gates, unauthorised access paths) | Environmental (moisture_low, pest_pressure_critical, yield_at_risk) |
| **Tool adapters** | algebra-parser, substitution-checker, calculator | system ctl tools | operations tool adapters |
| **Domain library components** | ZPD monitor, fluency tracker, fatigue estimator | — | — |
| **World-sim enabled** | Yes (space, nature, sports, general_math themes) | No | No |
| **Access roles** | user, domain_authority, it_support, qa, root | it_support, root | domain-specific |
| **LLM vs SLM routing** | LLM (external permitted) | SLM-only (`local_only: true`) | LLM (external permitted) |
| **Module structure** | Multiple algebra modules; module_map routes by student domain_id | Single system-core module | Single operations-level-1 module |

The system domain's `local_only: true` is a security boundary, not an architectural
exception — it reflects the domain's threat model (no operator command should leave the
trust boundary). Every other structural pattern is identical across all three packs.

The absence of a domain library in the system and agriculture packs is not a deficiency;
those domains have no multi-turn entity state to track at the depth education requires.
Every domain pack includes exactly as much structure as its subject area demands.

## G. Quick Reference — File Layout

The canonical domain pack directory layout. Pack-level items apply to the whole domain;
module-level items apply to one specific subject area (algebra-level-1, operations-level-1,
system-core, etc.) within the domain.

`cfg/runtime-config.yaml` is the pack's manifest to the engine: it registers adapters,
declares access control, maps entity domain IDs to module physics paths, and enables
world-sim features. The engine reads this file at session initialisation and wires up the
pack's components — no engine code changes are required to add a new domain pack.

For authoring a new domain pack from scratch (8-step authoring process), see
`domain-packs/README.md`. For the engine contract field reference, Phase A/B implementation
contract, and three-layer component distinction in depth, see
