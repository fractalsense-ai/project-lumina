# Audit Log Specification — V1

**Version:** 1.2.0  
**Status:** Active  
**Last updated:** 2026-03-08

---

## Overview

The **audit log** is the human-readable view of the System Logs. While the System Logs is a machine-readable append-only record store, the audit log is the structured report produced for governance review, compliance audits, and discrepancy resolution.

This document specifies what the audit log contains, who may request it, and how it is generated.

---

## Relationship to the System Logs

The audit log is not a separate store. It is a **view** generated from System Logs records on demand. The System Logs is the authoritative source; the audit log is derived.

```
System Log (append-only, machine-readable)
    ↓ audit log generator
Audit Log (human-readable structured report)
```

The audit log may be generated at any time by a party with appropriate audit rights. Generating an audit log does not modify the System Logs.

## Audit Log Contents

An audit log report for a session contains:

```

### What the Audit Log Does NOT Contain

- Conversation content
- Verbatim entity/subject responses
- Any information beyond structured telemetry

---

## Audit Rights

| Role | Scope |
|------|-------|
| Subject/Target (e.g., student, patient, operator) | Their own sessions only; structured summary format |
| Micro Authority / Domain Authority (e.g., teacher, clinician) | All sessions in their domain |
| Meta Authority (e.g., department head, supervising officer) | All sessions in their scope |
| Administration | All sessions institution-wide |

Audit requests outside the requestor's scope must be rejected and the rejection recorded as a `TraceEvent` in the System Logs.

---

## Audit Log Generation

The audit log generator reads from the System Logs and:
1. Verifies the hash chain for the requested session's records
2. Verifies that the active module `domain-physics.json` hash matches the committed `CommitmentRecord` for that policy version
3. Extracts the structured fields from each record
4. Formats them as a human-readable report
5. Appends a `TraceEvent` to the System Logs noting that an audit was generated (who requested it, for which session)

The audit log itself is not stored — it is generated fresh each time from the System Logs.

---

## Chain Integrity Check

Every audit log generation includes a chain integrity check:
- Walk all records for the session in order
- Verify `prev_record_hash` for each record
- Report `Chain intact: YES` or `Chain BROKEN at record <uuid>`

A broken chain is a reportable event requiring immediate escalation to the Meta Authority.

---

## Audit Trail of Audits

Every audit request is itself recorded as a `TraceEvent`:

```json
{
  "record_type": "TraceEvent",
  "event_type": "audit_requested",
  "session_id": "<session-being-audited>",
  "actor_id": "<pseudonymous-id-of-auditor>",
  "decision": "audit_log_generated",
  "metadata": {
    "requested_session": "<uuid>",
    "requested_by_role": "teacher"
  }
}
```

This ensures that even audits are themselves auditable.

---

## Provenance Expectations

When present in System Log metadata, provenance hash lineage fields should be surfaced in audit output so reviewers can trace packet integrity from policy activation through turn input, prompt contract, tool results, model payload, and final response.

---

## Discrepancy Resolution

If an audit reveals a discrepancy (e.g., a record that doesn't match expected behavior, a broken chain, or a missing record), the resolution process is:

1. Document the discrepancy in a `TraceEvent` with `event_type: discrepancy_detected`
2. Escalate to the Meta Authority via an `EscalationRecord`
3. Do not modify the System Logs
4. The Meta Authority reviews and commits a resolution `CommitmentRecord`

See [`../specs/reports-spec-v1.md`](reports-spec-v1.md) for the full discrepancy resolution workflow.
